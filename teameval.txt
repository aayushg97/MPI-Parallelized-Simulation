               Team Self Evaluation Form, Assignment #3

Each team must submit one copy of this self evaluation form. 
The members of each team should discuss how they
worked together and what to write for the evaluation.
If you worked alone leave column B blank

(1) List the names of your team members:

A: Noveen Sachdeva

 
B: Aayush Gupta

 
 
(2) Estimate how much time each team member devoted to this project, in HOURS.

  	                        A 	       	B
meetings 	  	  	4 		4
coding 	  	  	 	20		20
writeup 	  	  	10 		10
planning (alone) 	  	6  	 	6
total (including meetings) 	40  	  	40 


(3) Discuss the following.
(a) If you worked in a team, what were the major responsibilities
    of each team member?
	Aayush:	Distribution of initial values using scattering,
    		Ghost cell exchange,
		Handling of cases when process geometry does not divide N,
		Report writing

	Noveen: MPI & C++ optimizations,
	        Scaling studies,
	        Report writing

(b) Did you complete the assignment?
	Yes

(c) What were your major strengths and weaknesses in doing this
    assignment (individually or in a team)?
    If in a team, also discuss how your team worked together.
    	Good at asynchronous work
	Used tools like github, google docs and google sheets for collaboration

(d) What  lessons did you learn from these events.
	Use of MPI for parallel programming.
	Different kinds of simulations can be performed using MPI on super computers.

(e) If in a team, whether and how you plan to change the way
    your work together .
    	No

(f) Anything else that comes to mind.
	No
